# C++ implementation

This was designed to run on 2 separate systems and transmit data over wifi network.

You can run this on a single machine, build and run both server and client packages. 
> server requires command line arg port number, eg. `8989`

Notes: 
- the original implementation circa spring 2018.
- Dec 2021 updated to use Qt 6.
> - This requires building Qt from source with sctp.
